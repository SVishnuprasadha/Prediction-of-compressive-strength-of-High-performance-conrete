# Soft-Computing-Project
Brief Overview

My objective with this project was to extract the features and the properties that play a crucial role in determining compressive strength of the concrete and visualise it, consequently develop various models on the basis of this understanding. After feature extraction. I attempted to build multiple ANN models using Tensorflow and Keras framework followed by a SVM based model as well!

Compressive strength of concrete is a fundamental parameter that determines its quality. As per the R.C.C design course there are different types of sections out of which under reinforced section is mostly preferred. Under reinforced section is the type of section in which the steel yields first instead of concrete. This section is preferred since ductile failure of steel gives the needed premonition that the structure is unstable and needs to be rectified. Based on this concept the yield of steel i.e (grades of Fe like Fe-410, Fe-250..) is limited on the basis of the capacity of concrete. Therefore the scope of my regression analysis is relevant to the current industry requirements.

The project's purpose was to build to a neural network model of the type regression which should be capable of predicting the compressive strength of concrete. Before implementing the project I used extensive data cleaning and visualising process and to clean and scale the given dataset, followed by which I devised a neural network model with the help of Tensorflow and Keras framework and used multiple libraries and packages like Grid Search CV to hyper tune the number of layers and ultimately cross validated the predicted values with the actual values to check the accuracy of the model, also I made an accompanied support vector machine based model as well.
