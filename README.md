# Soft-Computing-Project
Soft Computing course project

My objective with this project was to extract the features and the properties that play a crucial role in determining compressive strength of the concrete and visualise it, consequently develop various models on the basis of this understanding. After feature extraction. I attempted to build multiple ANN models using Tensorflow and Keras framework followed by a SVM based model as well![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85796958/162601067-93cb3a88-9d7c-4ddf-8a8b-bd7452e1ebb2.png)
